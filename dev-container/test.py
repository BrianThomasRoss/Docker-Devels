    Welcome to the world of dev-containers you are no working from inside
    a virtualized instance of a linux ubuntu pre-loaded with miniconda zsh,
    and preconfigured conda environment.

    Some commands to try in the terminal:
    which conda             - path to miniconda
    conda info --envs       - list environments
    whoami                  - username
    ls -a                   - directory listing
    uname -a                - show kernel information
        and other sh bash and zsh commands.

    This container always produces the same environment on my computer as yours
    the same dependencies.
    
    Have fun
